### Changelog

We list all backwards-incompatible changes here. As described above, new additions and forwards-compatible changes donâ€™t need a new API version and can be found [here](#additions).

#### Latest

- We renamed the `context` field for work orders on customFieldDefinitions from `werkbonnen` to `work_orders`

#### 2019-03-13

- The property `tax` has been changed. Instead of giving you the `rate` of the tax it now shows the `id` and the `type` of the tax. This has been changed on the following endpoints:
  - `invoices.info`
  - `creditNote.info`
  - `quotations.info`

- We simplified the `products.info` and `products.list` endpoints:
  - `name` and `description` are no longer wrapped in a `translations` object. 
  - `external_id` was renamed to `code`
  - `prices` are temporarily no longer returned, to avoid confusion, as they didn't take into account price lists

#### 2019-01-24

- Previously, the `invoices.info` endpoint returned an _non-existing_ or _empty_ `extended_description` as an empty string, while `invoices.draft` and `invoices.update` didn't allow an empty string as `extended_description`.  
  From now on, `invoices.info` will return an _non-existing_ or _empty_ `extended_description` as `null`, to make this more consistent and interchangeable.

- Invoices can now have three statuses (`draft`, `outstanding` or `matched`) instead of two (`draft` or `booked`).  
  Therefore the `status` property in `invoices.list` and `invoices.info` will either return `outstanding` or `matched` for invoices that were previously just `booked`.  
  This is also reflected in the `status` filter on `invoices.list`: to allow you to still query all `outstanding` and `matched` invoices (previously all `booked`) , it now *only* accepts an array of filter values (eg. `["outstanding", "matched"]` or `["draft"]`).

- The property `local_business_number` was renamed to `national_identification_number` on the following endpoints:  
  - `companies.info`  
  - `companies.list`  
  - `companies.add`  
  - `companies.update`  
  - `invoices.info`  
  - `creditNotes.info`  

- An invoice number actually contains the bookyear, so from now on, you will see eg. `2018 / 27` instead of `27`.
  This is reflected in the `invoice_number` property in the `invoices.list` and `invoices.info` endpoints.

#### 2018-10-30

- The top-level property `customer` was removed on all deal endpoints.
  Earlier, this property could already be found under the `lead.customer` property.
  If you were still using the `customer` property, just wrap it in an object under a `lead` key.

- The `contacts.list` & `companies.list` endpoints used to give back an object under the `address` key.
  This object is now returned under the `primary_address` key.
