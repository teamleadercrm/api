## Projects [/projects-v2/projects]

> _This is the documentation of the new projects module. See the **Legacy Projects** documentation for the endpoints concerning our legacy projects module._

> ⚠️ (July 2023) The projects module has been completely overhauled and is currently only available for new project users. Existing project users only have access to the old projects module.
> Over the course of the next few months, next generation projects will also be made available to existing project users, including the migration of existing project data.

> To avoid naming collisions, all endpoints of the new projects module can be found under `/projects-v2`, for example `/projects-v2/projects.list`.
> To avoid confusing "new projects" with "creating a new project", we opted for "projects-v2" over "new" as the prefix.
