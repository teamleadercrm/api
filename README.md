> This repository has been archived. As part of our continuous efforts to improve our API documentation, we have introduced the [Teamleader Focus Developer Portal](https://developer.focus.teamleader.eu/).
>
> This platform is built upon [@teamleader/focus-api-specification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamleader/focus-api-specification), the successor of this [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) specification that uses the OpenAPI standard, a programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs that integrates better with our developer portal and other modern tooling.
